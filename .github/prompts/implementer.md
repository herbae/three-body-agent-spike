Follow these steps IN ORDER. Do not skip steps. Do not ask for human input.

## Issue #${ISSUE_NUM}: ${ISSUE_TITLE}

${ISSUE_BODY}

---

## Step 0: Understand the Project

Read ALL documentation for full context BEFORE writing any code.
Understand the tech stack, coding patterns, naming conventions, and project structure.

## Step 1: Create Branch

Create a branch in the current checkout:
- Branch name: autoagent/${ISSUE_NUM}-<short-slug>
- Base: ${BASE}
```bash
git checkout -b autoagent/${ISSUE_NUM}-<short-slug>
```

## Step 2: Plan

Create a structured implementation plan:
- Which files to change and why
- Which new files to create (prefer editing existing files)
- Which tests to add or update
- Any migration, config, or infrastructure changes

## Step 3: Implement

Execute the plan step by step:
- Match existing patterns -- look at neighboring code for style, naming, structure
- Keep it simple -- solve exactly what the issue asks. No over-engineering
- No new dependencies without strong justification
- Never introduce hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Validate user input at system boundaries

## Step 4: Test

- Add or update tests for every behavioral change
- Run the test suite and fix failures
- If the repo has coverage thresholds, do not lower them

## Step 5: Commit, Push, Open PR

1. Commit with clear messages grouped by context
2. Push: git push -u origin <branch>
3. Create PR: gh pr create --base ${BASE}
- PR title: conventional commits format (feat: / fix:), under 70 chars, user-facing change
- PR description must include 'Closes #${ISSUE_NUM}'

## Rules

- Do NOT refactor code unrelated to the issue
- Do NOT update dependencies unless the issue requires it
- Do NOT create config files or abstractions for hypothetical future needs
- Do NOT force-push or rewrite history
- Do NOT merge the PR -- leave for human review
